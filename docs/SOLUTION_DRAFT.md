## Summary

A private M-of-N multisig for the Logos Execution Zone. Members hold shielded LEZ accounts and
approve proposals **anonymously**: the chain records that a threshold was reached, and never which
members reached it.

The full lifecycle runs on the LEZ public testnet — a 2-of-3 multisig created, funded, proposed
against, approved twice by shielded members with `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0`, and executed, moving 60 of a
100 treasury. `./scripts/verify-onchain.sh` re-checks all of it from public data alone and exits 0.
CI runs the same lifecycle against a real standalone sequencer on every push. A Basecamp `ui_qml`
module installs, opens, and reads that deployment on screen.

The precise on-chain claim, stated so a reviewer can check it rather than take it on trust:

- An approval is a **privacy-preserving transaction**. LEZ's privacy-preserving circuit runs
  `env::verify` over the multisig program **and** a chained membership program. There is no public
  approve path — not one that is discouraged, one that does not exist.
- The proof is bound to a **live** shielded account, not merely to a derived key. LEZ's circuit
  proves the approver controls an account whose commitment is in the current commitment set; our
  membership guest re-derives that same account id from its own witnesses and refuses if it differs.
  Dropping that assertion is the derivation-only pattern rejected in prize PR #91, and a test fails
  if it is removed.
- The proposal account holds an **approval count and a set of nullifiers**. It has no roster, no
  bitmap, and no field that could hold one.
- The member set, the threshold **and the membership verifier's ImageID** are all committed in the
  PDA seed. Lowering M, substituting the member set, or naming a permissive verifier does not weaken
  the multisig — it names one that does not exist.

**Outstanding, and not glossed:** the narrated video is not recorded, and the public explorer has
indexed the two program deployments but not yet the five lifecycle transactions. See
[What is not done](#what-is-not-done).

**Explorer index, honestly:** the two program deployments render; the five lifecycle transactions are
on chain and answer over JSON-RPC, but the explorer has not indexed them yet.
`./scripts/check-explorer-links.sh` reports exactly which and exits 75 rather than passing quietly.
The evidence does not depend on the explorer — `verify-onchain.sh` reads the accounts directly:

```
$ ./scripts/verify-onchain.sh
  config       : 2-of-3, owner ok, rehashes to its own address
  verifier     : matches the deployed membership program (ADR-002)
  proposal     : 2 approvals of 2 required, executed, all nullifiers distinct
  FULL M       : evidence uses the full threshold, not a lowered tier
  payment      : 9NJmD3aw… holds 60, covering the 60 approved (INV-7)
  privacy      : proposal holds a count + nullifiers, no member identity (P-F2)
  VERIFIED from public chain data alone.
  2 privacy-preserving transaction(s) — approvals really did take the private path
```

## Approach

### The anchor

```
config_hash = SHA256( DS_CONFIG ‖ member_root[32] ‖ M[1] ‖ N[1] ‖ multisig_id[32] ‖ membership_program_id[32] )
```

The config account lives at `for_public_pda(program_id, PdaSeed(config_hash))`, so its address
attests to its own configuration, and the program re-hashes the stored fields and rejects a mismatch.
Lowering M or naming a permissive verifier does not produce a weaker multisig — it produces a
different address, where nothing exists and nobody has funded anything.

**Nullifier:** `nf = SHA256(DS_NF ‖ nsk ‖ multisig_id ‖ proposal_id)` — deterministic per
(member, multisig, proposal), preimage-hiding, and keyed to `nsk` rather than an account id, so a
member cannot vote twice from another of their 2^128 addresses. Full reasoning in
[ADR-001](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-001-architecture.md) and
[ADR-002](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-002-bind-verifier-to-config-hash.md).

### Why `execute` carries no proof

Answered up front, because a previous submission to this prize was closed partly for *"the execute
transaction contains no proof"*.

The proof is at **approve** time. Each approval is a privacy-preserving transaction whose validity
depends on LEZ's circuit verifying the multisig program **and** the chained membership program. By
the time `execute` runs, the threshold is already a fact on chain: a set of distinct, proof-backed
nullifiers. `execute` reads that verified state and moves funds if `count >= M`. It takes no secret
input and asserts nothing that was not already proven, so there is nothing left for a proof to
establish.

**Keeping it public is deliberate, and better for privacy.** Anyone may execute a proposal that has
reached its threshold — including a non-member. If execution required a member, the executor *would
be* a member, and that would link a member to the proposal. A permissionless execute is what makes
criterion **P-F4** achievable at all.

**Which raises the obvious question: if anyone may execute, what stops them redirecting the money?**
The approvals cover the *proposal*; every other part of the transaction is chosen by whoever submits
it. So `execute` pins both ends of the transfer — the funds leave the multisig's own config PDA, and
the recipient must be the account the proposal named, or the call is refused (**INV-7**, error `7012`
on chain).

This was a real hole, not a hypothetical one. `execute` destructured the approved action as
`{ amount, .. }`, discarding the recipient, and took a caller-supplied treasury account that nothing
tied to the multisig — so a submitter could have redirected an approved payment to themselves while
every approval still verified. It was found by running the program through the risc0 executor rather
than by reading it, and neither demo script would have caught it: both proposed a transfer to one
address and then executed with `--treasury $CREATOR --recipient $CREATOR`, moving money from an
account to itself. `execute_refuses_a_recipient_the_proposal_did_not_name` is the regression test;
with the binding removed it fails, showing the multisig paying an account the proposal never named.

### The Basecamp module

A `ui_qml` module that installs through Basecamp's own Install Local Package, opens from
Applications → Blockchain, and reads the deployment above: the Config panel shows the 2-of-3 and the
membership ImageID, the Proposal panel shows two nullifiers and `executed`, and the Accounts panel
lists the wallet.

Two facts about Basecamp had to be found by reading its binaries, and both are filed upstream in
[`docs/BUGS_FILED.md`](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/BUGS_FILED.md):

1. A module's QML runs in Basecamp's main process while its plugin runs in a `ui-host` child, and the
   QML reaches the plugin only through a **replica factory** plugin the module must ship
   (`<name>_replica_factory.dylib`, IID `logos.view.replica_factory/1.0`). Nothing documents it, no
   header ships, and the generator does not emit one. Without it every panel renders and does
   nothing.
2. Basecamp runs a hardened runtime whose only entitlement is `disable-library-validation`. Its QML
   sandbox JIT-compiles a regex, and without `allow-jit` that traps — so it must be started with
   `QT_ENABLE_REGEXP_JIT=0` until the entitlement is added.

**The Approve panel deliberately cannot submit.** An approval's witness is the member's nullifier
secret key, and the module's generated C ABI builds *public* transactions — publishing it would be
the exact failure this prize is about. Approvals go through the SDK/CLI, and
`scripts/check-basecamp-privacy.sh` fails the build if anything reconnects that path.

### Why Logos

[why-logos.md](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/why-logos.md). Briefly: this scheme
needs shielded accounts whose repeated use is unlinkable, and execution that can depend on secrets the
chain never sees. LEZ provides both in the base layer; on a chain where validators must see the
inputs, it is not possible at all.

## Success Criteria Checklist

All 21 criteria from the prize. Statuses match
[`docs/criteria-checklist.md`](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/criteria-checklist.md),
which carries the full evidence for each.

**Functionality**

- [x] **P-F1** Shielded member approves without revealing identity — two privacy-preserving approvals
      on chain (txs 5 and 6 above); `crates/sdk/tests/peer_privacy.rs` shows `prepare_approval` has no
      parameter for another member's identity
- [x] **P-F2** On-chain verifier confirms M approvals without recording which — the proposal account
      holds a count and nullifiers; `Proposal` has six fields and none can hold a roster
- [x] **P-F3** A member cannot approve twice — nullifier keyed to `nsk`, not to an account id;
      error **1002** (`7002` on chain), with a test for voting from a second own address
- [x] **P-F4** Completed execution unlinkable to any individual member — `execute` is public and
      submitted by the payer; nothing in it or in the account names an approver
- [x] **P-F5** Proof generation runs client-side on a standard laptop — 115.97 s standalone,
      ≈19 min 26 s composed at 8.74 GB peak; repeated 2026-09-09 at 22 and 21 min
- [x] **P-F6** Reference integration on LEZ testnet with shielded members — the deployment above
- [x] **P-F7** ≥1 multisig on testnet, create → propose → approve-to-threshold → execute,
      reproducible — `./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh`, re-checked by `./scripts/verify-onchain.sh`
- [x] **P-F8** Full documentation and a clean public repository — 128 tests, ADRs, security model,
      error codes, limitations, `BUGS_FILED.md`, and a documentation index in the README

**Usability**

- [x] **P-U1** Module/SDK for building Logos modules — `pmsig-sdk`, `pmsig-core`, `pmsig-store`,
      `pmsig-cli`; the integration guide's code is a compiled example
- [x] **P-U2** Basecamp GUI: local build, downloadable assets, loadable — the `.lgx` above installs,
      opens, and reads the deployed multisig. Scope: `darwin-arm64` only, and Basecamp must start
      with `QT_ENABLE_REGEXP_JIT=0` (host bug, filed)
- [x] **P-U3** IDL for the LEZ program, using SPEL — `artifacts/multisig-idl.json`, generated from
      `#[lez_program]` at compile time; the SPEL CLI built working commands from it

**Reliability**

- [x] **P-R1** Proof failures handled gracefully with a clear error to the member
- [x] **P-R2** Partial approvals (< M) preserved and resumable across client restarts
- [x] **P-R3** Deterministic, documented error codes for invalid-proof and double-vote cases

**Performance**

- [x] **P-P1** CU cost of each on-chain operation documented, numerically —
      [`docs/cu-costs.md`](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/cu-costs.md) for all
      four instructions

**Supportability**

- [x] **P-S1** Deployed and tested on LEZ testnet — see the deployment table
- [x] **P-S2** E2E tests against a **standalone** LEZ sequencer in CI —
      [run 34275830322](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/actions/runs/34275830322), 2 h 54 m,
      two 75-minute proofs at `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0`
- [x] **P-S3** CI green on the default branch
- [x] **P-S4** README documents E2E usage: deploy steps, addresses, CLI **and** Basecamp
- [x] **P-S5** Reproducible `./demo.sh` against a real local sequencer with `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0`
- [ ] **P-S6** Narrated video showing proof generation and confirming `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0` —
      **not recorded**; script ready, URL pending

## FURPS Self-Assessment

### Functionality

Creates a multisig, proposes a treasury transfer, accepts anonymous approvals from shielded members,
and executes once the threshold is met. The privacy property is the product: the chain records a
count and nullifiers, never identities. What it does **not** do: the member set is fixed at creation,
there is no rotation or revocation, and the only proposed action is a treasury transfer — the
`ProposedAction` enum has one variant, deliberately, so the reference integration is small enough to
verify.

### Usability

Three entry points, and they are honestly different. The CLI drives the full lifecycle. The SDK is
what a member uses to produce an approval, because that needs the prover. The Basecamp module reads
chain state and submits the public instructions, and its Approve page explains why it will not submit
an approval instead of failing at it. A first install points at nothing: four Settings fields have to
be filled, which the module says on the page rather than leaving a reader to guess.

### Reliability

Failure paths are tested rather than assumed: proof failure, double approval, an invalid witness, a
recipient the proposal did not name, and a config account at a valid address holding different
values. Error codes are deterministic and documented. The scripts fail rather than skip — a missing
tool aborts the run instead of passing quietly, which is what makes a green meaningful. Partial
approvals survive a client restart.

### Performance

Measured, not estimated: 602,662 cycles and 115.97 s for the standalone membership proof; a composed
approval — the one a member actually pays — at ≈19 min 26 s and 8.74 GB peak on an 8-core laptop with
no GPU, reproduced twice on a second day at 22 and 21 minutes, and 75 minutes each on a 4-core CI
runner. On-chain CU is documented per instruction. The practical constraint is **free RAM**: about
9 GB, and a machine with a browser open swaps and looks hung.

### Supportability

The repository is the support surface: ADRs for the two decisions that matter, a security model, an
error-code table, `tried-failed.md` for what went wrong and how it was caught, and `BUGS_FILED.md`
for the upstream papercuts. Every claim in this file has a script behind it that a reviewer can run —
`verify-onchain.sh`, `check-explorer-links.sh`, `check-basecamp-contract.sh`,
`preflight-submission.sh` — and each exits non-zero when it should.

`RISC0_DEV_MODE=0`. `demo-fast.sh` is a development tour, generates no proof, and is **not** cited as
evidence anywhere.

## What is not done

Listed first-class, because the difference between built and demonstrated is what this prize's gates
test.

- **No narrated video.** P-S6 unmet. The script is written; the recording is a human gate.
- **The public explorer has not indexed all of the evidence.** Every transaction answers over
  JSON-RPC and `verify-onchain.sh` reads them all; the explorer renders the two program deployments
  but not yet the five lifecycle transactions. `check-explorer-links.sh` says which, and exits 75.
- **The Basecamp module ships one platform variant**, `darwin-arm64` — the machine it was built on.
  Nothing in it is macOS-specific; no second machine was available to build and test the others, and
  shipping an untested variant is worse than shipping none.
- **Basecamp needs `QT_ENABLE_REGEXP_JIT=0`** to open the module at all. That is the host's bug,
  reproduced and filed, not a defect in this module — but it is a step a reviewer has to take.
- **Approvals cannot be submitted from the GUI.** By design, and explained on the page: the witness is
  a spending key and the module builds public transactions.

Full list:
[`docs/limitations.md`](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/limitations.md).

## Honest notes

- SPEL is pinned to `main`, not the v0.6.0 release, because the release pins LEZ v0.2.0 and derives
  private account ids the live testnet does not recognise. An unreleased dependency is a real cost; it
  is taken deliberately and recorded.
- Things we got wrong and fixed are in
  [`docs/tried-failed.md`](https://github.com/pramadanif/lp-0002-private-multisig/blob/main/docs/tried-failed.md),
  including a leak of the member's spending key into the guest journal that we shipped, then caught by
  decoding the journal rather than trusting a byte scan — and a second instance of the same class,
  where the same key was found sitting in a run log.
